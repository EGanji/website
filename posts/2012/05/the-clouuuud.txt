Yes, the "cloud".  I hate that buzzword.  I see it everywhere, and seemingly every day I see tech articles and tweets extolling its virtues, heralding it as the next big thing - a means to trade being tethered to a general-purpose computer at a desk for being tethered to a faceless corporation's ecosystem, accessed through whatever locked-down devices they see it fit to support.

Of course, as with anything that takes control and privacy away from users, there is backlash.  _Tonight at 11: are your Facebook photos really private?  The truth may surprise you._  Next thing you know you have parents making their children wear `infrared LED hats <http://hacknmod.com/hack/blind-cameras-with-an-infrared-led-hat/>`_ to birthday parties.  In order to capitalize on this panic some services have started advertising themselves as an alternative to cloud storage.  Not all of them, however, understand what "cloud" storage means.

Like this recent email from my credit union (emphasis mine)...
