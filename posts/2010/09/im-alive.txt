Someone pinged me to say that I need to update this more often... or at all, really.

My goal with this blog was to fill it with useful content, like clever hacks, product reviews and original musings.  I didn't want to turn it into a diary.  And I won't.  That being said, here are a few things I feel are of note...

* **Droiiiiiiiid**... Yeah, I dropped the Storm like a bad habit.  I'm now rocking a HTC Droid Incredible, and it lives up to it's name.  The minute I was able to, I rooted it and installed `CyanogenMod 6 <http://www.cyanogenmod.com/>`_ to get the stock Android experience (plus some).
* **Vrooooom**... A car, I need a new one.  I'm currently trying to decide between a hybrid or ICE Honda Civic.  I'd go with the extra $$$ for a hybrid, but the reduced acceleration is kind of a turn off.  I figure this is a decision best made after test driving.  Don't want to put the horse before the carriage.
* **10001101**... I've been dabbling in writing Android applications.  Of course, finding the motivation to follow through on a junk project is very difficult.  Work still has me pounding away at ASP.NET/C#.  For all of the negative flack MS gets, I really do like the features of the ecosystem.

I'll be updating the site/blog some more over the next few weeks.  I promise!
